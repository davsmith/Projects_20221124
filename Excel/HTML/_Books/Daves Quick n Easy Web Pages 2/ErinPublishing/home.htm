    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    <p> Welcome to erinbooks.com, the online home of Erin Publications.</p>
    <p> We publish guide books which serve as both textbooks and reference books.</p>
    <p> Beginners can use our books as textbooks to learn a subject totally new to them.
        They can then put that knowledge to use while keeping our books available as reference
        books to refresh their memory.</p>
    <p> Our books are designed for self-study to use but work well in a classroom setting too.
        They utilize an easy-to-follow format and are written in plain English</p>
    <p> All topics are cross-referenced and indexed.  Bibliographic referneces
        list sources of more detailed information on each topic.</p>
