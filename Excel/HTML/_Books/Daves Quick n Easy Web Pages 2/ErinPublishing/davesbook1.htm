                <p> Want to create your own web site? Not sure where to begin? Afraid it might be expensive?
                    Let Dave show you where to find free web design software, free web server space,
                    and a free web-based e-mail address.</p>							
                <p> Then Dave will guide you step-by-step through the web site creation process.
                    Begin with a simple page. Add links, color, images, a background, animation,
                    a message banner, and sound. Learn how to use tables to achieve a professional layout.</p>							
                <p> Transform your simple page into a multi-page web site. Add an image map, a
                    visitor counter, a guest book, and a password-protected area. Convert to a free
                    easy-to-remember web site address. Then register your web site with the key search engines.</p>											
                <p> Dave's Quick 'n' Easy Web Pages is used by North American educators from fifth grade
                    through college. Great for small business owners too.</p>
