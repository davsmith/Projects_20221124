         &lt;p&gt;This stash was placed on a hiking trail in Kauai -- the hike is
         beautiful and is not too strenuous (though it is several miles in).
         The trail is called 'Canyon Trail' (NOT to be confused with the
         Waimea Canyon Trail, even though it is similar) and is about 4
         miles round trip. Once you get close using the GPS, you should be
         able to find the stash behind a tree...happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is in a plastic container inside of a dark garbage bag.  The cache contains a log book and a couple of wooden pencils and a sharpener so that you can record your visit.

--- 8/5/2002 Update: Cache contents refreshed in late June with a
new container. Hopefully this one will stay dry, as long as no one
puts a can of Dr. Pepper in the cache just before first freeze.
I'll post new pictures as soon as I get them. --- 9/19/2006 Update:

It was in a tall vertical tree (most of the trees near this spot were not vertical after Isabel.) The cache is now about 15 feet away.Years ago, you could walk thru this area and find gravesites everywhere. But then overgrowth started to cover and dislodge the markers and many tumbled down the hill.After years of neglect, tomb stones were gathered up and now sit in a pile at the top of the hill. The park is used mostly by dog walkers and hikers cutting through to Rock Creek.Burials ceased in 1950. In the 1970's the cemetery was saved from being replaced by a townhouse development and placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

 Cache is a small 30 cal ammo can. The last cache in this Park was
compromised so this one has been camoflaged to make it harder to
find. It is located about 100' from a main road and near a small
foot path. This park is very popular with lots of foot traffic all
times of the year so please be careful when logging and rehiding.
When you rehide there is no need to pile on extra rocks, etc.
Please don't do that as it makes it too easy to find for the
neighborhood kids. You can park at Grand Blvd and 18th Ave or
Bernard and 20th near the Japanese Gardens. After you find the
cache spend a little time enjoying the Park, The Gaiser
Conservatory, The Duncan Gardens, the Ferris Perennial garden, rose
hill, and the Japanese gardens. The cache is loaded with an array
of different things. Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>Behind and under a large rock formation.

Kauai.</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="True">On the south shore of Kauai there is a cavern in the rocks that is
probably 50 feet deep, 100 feet across and 150 feet wide. It's
called Maha'ulepu and is a large sinkhole in the limestone and the
subject of on-going excavation and analysis. The attempt is to
understand the coastal flora and fauna going back more than 10,000
years. The researchers have found fossilized pollen and seeds so
they know what was growing there in 'pre-Hawaiian' times. They've
now cleared much of the area surrounding the cache and have planted
several of these varieties of plants. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU
WALK (STAY ON TRAIL) so you don't step on their plants. Also, the
folks who work in the area know about the geocache and really love
it when geocachers stop to chat with them. You'll find them very
friendly and eager to discuss their activities. It doesn't hurt
that the cache is near a beautiful beach and surrounded by
wonderful hiking opportunities. &lt;br&gt;
The cache is a tupperware bowl, originally containing a log book, a
travel bug for our dog, Jake, a Moffett Field golf ball, a ladies
wrist watch (runs), Luiz Gonzalez baseball card, Guide Dogs for the
Blind key ring, a butterfly necklace and a small white, cloth
mouse.&lt;br&gt;
To get to the cache, drive down Poipu Road, past the Hyatt Regency.
Soon the paved road will end (UPDATE, NOV, 2006--there is
apparently a new sign at this point that says 'No Trespassing'. My
wife says it's always been there, but I'm not sure. Most of the
property in this area is owned by Steve Case, of AOL 'fame'. In the
past he has been very accomodating to the public to let them use
it. Perhaps he's changed his rules. At any rate, it seems to me
that there is little risk to continuing on, if for no other reason
than you need to drive down the unpaved road to get to the
horseback riding place. If it were me, I'd keep going, and if
anyone asked what you were doing you can tell them you're going to
the beach. I'd appreciate feedback.) Keep driving for ~1.7 miles
(the road used to have tons of potholes but has been graded in 2005
so it's reasonably smooth all the way to the parking area.) Keep
going straight when you see the sign for the horse stable. This
road ends at another cane road...turn right. Go .7 miles to a large
parking area. If there's a guard in the little shack, just tell him
you're going to the beach and he'll tell you that he closes the
gates at 7:00 p.m. As you enter the parking area, there's a path to
the beach at about 2:00 (west). Park and take this path about 100
feet to the beach and turn on your GPSr. Good luck! 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;Note on cache maintenance: My wife and I travel
to Kauai approximately 3-4 times per year. In addition, we share a
condo with another couple who visit there with about the same
frequency, and he has agreed to help me maintain this Kauai Cavern
Cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>Head west on the beach until you cross a small stream that enters the ocean (~ 1/4 mile).  Immediately on the other side of that stream is a trail that the horseback riders use.  Head up that trail.  There are two ways to get from the trail to the cache...one is via a small trail under the trees that starts about 5 feet from the trailhead, going off to the right.  This is the preferred approach as there is increased horse traffic on the horse trail (and we all know what that means).  The other way is to go up the horse trail a couple of hundred feet, just past the point where your GPSr tells you the cache is off to your immediate right.  You'll find a small trail there which will also take you to the cache.  There aren't as many trees using this route so your GPSr might work more effectively.  Once you get to the cavern and are standing next to the two large rocks overlooking the cavern, the cache is behind the low fallen tree that is immediately behind you.

There is no need for bushwacking.  Please remember to bring along your own pencil or pen to sign the log sheet, and re-hide the cache as you found it.

Be sure to explore the inside of the tree after you retrieve the cache; in fact, this natural hideout provides a convenient place to sign the log sheet unnoticed.  The view of Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains, and the passing trains are also worth a few moments of reflective repose.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>[spoiler]: on the outside of the tree, at the base of the north side</groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="32087994"><groundspeak:date>2007-09-02T07:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had to search for awhile on this one, but eventually tracked it down.

Park.</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="True">Around 1912, during the early development of Manito Park, loamy
soil was discovered while children were playing in this undeveloped
part of the park. Park Superintendant John W. Duncan knew that this
exceptionally rich soil was valuable. To help other Spokane area
parks become established, over 42,500 loads of the loamy soil was
hauled out to help create park gardens all over Spokane. Duncan
transformed the remains of Manito's lowered barren landscape into a
beautiful formal European Renaissance garden. It was called the
Sunken Gardens until 1941 when the Park Board changed the name to
honor Duncan for all his years of dedicated service. 
&lt;p&gt;Today Duncan Gardens with is symmetrical plantings and large
central granite fountain, is a lovely place for summer chamber
music concerts, weddings and photo shootings. It's beauty is most
impressive when viewed from its northern end, standing in the front
of the Gaiser Conservatory and looking south over the massive
floral arrangements. Come, enjoy the view, then take a stroll
through Manito Park's sunken Duncan Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache was originally a regular size ammo can. After being
muggled, another ammo can was hidden in a new location on 4/28/05.
This was replaced with a small ammo lock-n-lock box after being
muggled again on 3/25/07. Unfortunately, the cache was muggled a
third time and is now a micro in a new spot! &lt;b&gt;The reward is
seeing the gardens!!!

This one is so ridiculously easy that we really shouldn’t even have to provide cache coordinates, but we did. This is not quite a drive by cache, but it's close. Please park on the street at these coordinates: 47 40.895   122 10.359. There’s no need to search vegetation. The property owners have given permission for the cache to be located here. And did I mention that this one is ridiculously easy?  The driveway is a dead end so don't head into that black hole.

Fly on over to the Jetson’s Orbit City Travel Bug Space Port and trade your travel bugs. 

Our request is that if you take a TB, please leave a TB if you have one, but don't let that stop you from grabbing one when you are there if you can't trade. We will keep the cache supplied with other fun Jetson and space related toys so the kids (both young and old) can have something fun to take even if they don’t have a TB to exchange.

Also – this is located in a residential neighborhood. Please don’t go hunting after 10 p.m. or before 7 a.m. as the muggle neighbors might think you are up to no good…

garage and shed, and saw some deer. Then I went about a half mile
down the road before coming to an impassible part overgrown with
poison oak. Right before that, however, the road had about a dozen
scats that were the territorial signs of a mountain lion, probably
a male. It made me look over my shoulder a lot on the way back!&lt;br&gt;

(For a description of the trail see:  http://www.vtrail.com/byalphabet/mtrails/middleforktr.html)).  The terrain is fairly flat and the wide trail is easy to follow with only a few gentle ups and down. Reception at the cache site can be difficult at times, so spoiler photos are provided below.

To get to the  trailhead from Seattle, take Interstate 90 eastbound to Exit 34. At the end of the exit ramp, set your odometer to zero and turn left on SE Edgewick Road. At 0.4 mile, turn right onto SE Middle Fork Road (which becomes Forest Road 56). Reach a fork at 1.4 miles, and stay right. At 3 miles, the road becomes dirt, and it can be rough from here on out depending on when it was last graded (http://www.nwsource.com/outdoors/scr/of_detail.cfm?category=biking&amp;rt=41176).  At approximately 12 miles, there is a large parking lot on the right (N 47 32.871 W 121 32.222; note that you’ll need a NW Forest Pass to park anywhere out here).

So much was going on - brilliant sun, high tide, passing cruise ships, a "Mendoza line" falcon (about 1 for 5 in dive attempts to snare a fish), all kinds of people.  The girls (*pixie*, Miss K and little "i" played in the sand collecting seaweed ... just a wonderful beach.

</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="False">My family and I have been visiting Mt. Rainier National Park for over 20 years.  And our favorite all-time campground is Ohanapecosh.  Isn’t that a great word?  They say it comes from the Indians of the area and means “standing on the edge”.  The Ohanapecosh River runs through the campground.  It is swift, clear and very cold.  Our son use to jump from the rocks into the river......but he sure got out fast!   

During this years visit, I wanted to place a geocache in the area.  But as you all know, physical caches are not allowed in National Parks and GC is limiting virtuals. Thus, the cache is just a mile down the road, outside the park entrance gate.  

Reception is poor, so coords will be jumpy.  So here’s HELP:  stand with your back to the large southwestern pillar/post of the entry gate arch.  Using your compass, take a bearing of 200 degrees (that's SSW to those of you who are compass-challenged).  Go approximately 45 feet to find the cache.  The container is a brown plastic liter jar. And while in the area, don’t forget to stop at Ohanapecosh Campground and the Visitors Center.

Henry’s View Cache&lt;/a&gt; we thought Navajo's View would also be an
excellent place for a cache to give you cachers an excuse to stop
to view the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, The Burr
Trial, Henry Mountains, Navajo Mountain, etc. We hope you enjoy the
views as much as we do!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of my favorite views in Nevada.  If at all possible, visit this location during the early morning or evening... and definately bring your camera!!!

This cache is a white plastic rectangular box with a gray lid, and should be an easy find.

There is NO NEED to climb on steep hills, cliffs, or embankments, and there is no need to stand in the road.

Please note that there may be lots of people around... especially on weekends, so be discreet as possible!

Also, if anyone has one of those little notes that describes a geocache and what to do if it was found by mistake, please deposit one in the cache, as I forgot to have one printed up.

Beautiful location in Kokee State Park to find the hibernating dinosaur cache (deposited in September 2003 and undisturbed until YOU find it!)

Begin on the Nua’lolo Trail (ask for directions from the friendly staff at the Lodge or check the model of the mountains at the front door)

It is a moderate hike (three children - 4, 6, and 8 years old, made the hike and we discovered one of them was really a  billygoat! ( AKA Aubrey) 

At .25 mile marker - fork in the path, go to the left and start looking for the fossilized dinosaur print in the middle of the path… Continue past the wire fence (.50 mile marker) and look up at the guava tree at the .75 mile marker for a snack. 

 Continue walking and soon you will come up the rise and into the mouth of the Valley of the Dinosaurs, elevation 3382 feet.   Rocks mark both sides of the path.  

The cache is filled with wonderful items – Aloha Angels, Handmade Kauai greeting card, origami crane made with love, Kauai key chain, Boomzilla TB, Koosh ball, Kokee pencil and glow in the dark starfish.  Enjoy the cache and sit on the soft grass to enjoy the view, a picnic lunch and then continue on to the ridge to view heaven…  Aloha!

This historic Olmsted Park is beloved by residents and visitors alike. The cache is a green ammo can.</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="False">In 1876 the City purchased 40 acres for $2,000 from a sawmill engineer, J. M. Colman (Colman Park) without specifying purpose other than "municipal".

Ordinance 642 in 1885 defined the purpose as "Washelli Cemetery" but two years later it was changed to "Lake View Park" and gravesites were ordered removed. By 1893, the Department had cleared about six acres of timber and planted a nursery supplemented with a greenhouse and hotbed.

Between 1887 and 1904 the park was improved with paths, lawns, beds of flowers, settees and tables for picnickers, and children’s swings, together with native growth, the only greenhouse in the system, and the high pressure reservoir. 1904-1909 the Olmsted Brothers prepared formal plans - gardens system of macadam drives, lily ponds, children’s wading pool and shelter, combination pergola, music pavilion and comfort station, and conservatory building - all completed by 1912.

This park is busy at all times, regardless of the park's posted hours. Because of that, the police patrol it constantly. However, being busy means its a great place to people watch.

It was difficult to find a good hiding spot for the cache because so much of the brush and undergrowth has been removed. Please take care when concealing the cache when/if you locate it. The container is a lock-n-lock covered in camouflage tape.

This is half way between the Art Museum and the Children's pool.

Apparently this park's groundcrew is aware of this cache and when they trim the location, they will move the cache and re-cover it. That would account for the bit of "cache drift" over time. The hint says ten feet but it could be more. Please post any coordinate variations you may come up with.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>About ten feet from the right end of the hedge.

Its located on Route 66 (Da) in the town of Hackberry,AZ. 

  The owners John and Kerry have one of the nicest collection of old time memoribilia showing some of the cars and tools that would have been found along route 66 years ago. This is a must see place for all cachers especially those of a slighty older age.

  So when you visit this great store, From the past,And if you have trouble finding the cache, Just go to the counter and tell John your a geocacher and he'll show you where the cache is.

  This ones easy. Just drive up to the old gas pump and your almost there. We could'nt pass up an opportunity to place a cache near this place. Near by you can get a glimpse of the pass. The way it used to be along Route 66. Enjoy!

square acre of land, reserving "a space of sufficient sice (sic) to
bury ten persons, and the privilege of crossing said tract for such
purpose. Said tract to be used - a burrying (sic) yard for the
dead." On June 18, 1904, George and Emma Pennington deeded the same
tract to "The Trustees of the Haynie Cemetery Association" and
buried twin sons there. In the beginning, those who worked to help
clear the ground received a cemetery lot in payment. 
&lt;p&gt;The name "Haynie" is said to have come from a surveyor by the
name of "Haney" who was hired to survey for a railroad between
Blaine, Lynden and Bellingham.&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is a clear-orange water bottle.  I listed it as small because the opening isn't big like a rubbermaid container.

you might notice an original stretch of road to Lahaina that traverses 
across the modern Highway. This original stretch of road to Lahaina 
along these cliffs was 4 miles long and had 115 sharp curves. The road
was built by prison laborers around 1900 to replace the The Lahaina Pali 
Trail which now is a historic trail that is still traveled today.

There are several places along the Highway you can still access the 
narrow old road but the modern Honoapi`ilani Highway cuts directly into
the large cliffs of the pali and many parts of the old road are now "run
over" by the new highway or just end at a high cliff points of the cut
cliffs.

This cache is located at the most scenic and most accessible part of the
old road to Lahaina. To get to this Cache you will need to park at
the parking area for the Lahaina Pali Trail and walk up to the road.

The parking area is at:
  20 47.506 N
 156 33.826 W

walk up the trail to the road and then just follow the road. Bring water! as the hike can be very hot .... 
At one point following the road you will see some rocks in the road 
and a sign that leads you off the road to follow the Lahaina Pali 
Trail. DO NOT take the trail to get to the cache...  
However, after finding the cache you can go back and hike
that trail if you want..

pass the trail head and keep following the road you will run into 
it.. You should never leave the road...


If you choose to go back and hike the Lahaina Pali Trail be sure
to bring lots of water and be prepared for a long 5 mile hot
and dry uphill trail...

The Lahaina Pali Trail is an historic trail, probably part of the old Hawaiian 
"Alaloa" (the long road) that once circled Maui. The Lahaina Pali Trail was first
 built as a horse and foot trail about 200 years ago. The five-mile trail goes 
up and over the pali (sea cliffs) of the southern shore of West Maui between
 Ma`alaea and the Ukumehame area on the Lahaina side. The hot, dry trail 
traverses scrubland, kiawe forest and deep gulches. The old trail was 
replaced with a narrow winding road built by prison laborers around 1900. 
The modern Honoapi`ilani Highway replaced that old road in 1951.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>Under the big boulder</groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="23719941"><groundspeak:date>2007-02-12T08:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">A great spot to watch the whales without all of the people.

The cache is a long rubbermade container, wrapped in a black  plastic bag.  Initial contents include several small toy cars, a monster, and a log book. Please keep it well hidden.

beautiful surroundings. The cache should be easy enough to find. My
coordinates were bouncing around both days that I checked them, so
I took a lot of readings and averaged them out. Stay on the
asphalt, don't go climbing any fences or stairs, and you'll find
it. (Note: Google Map for this location is misleading, although the
satellite view is more helpful.) 
&lt;p&gt;The easiest (and safest) northbound access is via exit 460,
rather than stopping on the Interstate. The exit comes up sooner
than you think! At the stop sign, continue straight to find the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If southbound, take exit 460, keep to the right, turn right to
go over the bridge, then turn left and you're there. It is legal to
backtrack to the bridge again to get back on southbound I-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE on State Status&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had said, "Trust your GPS!" but I should also have said, "Do
plenty of research!" This cache is indeed just inside Colorado.
While the State Constitutions of both &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www2.michie.com/colorado/lpext.dll/Infobase2/11?fn=document-frame.htm&amp;amp;f=templates&amp;amp;2.0"&gt;
Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll/nmsa2007feb/1/6?f=templates&amp;amp;fn=document-frame.htm&amp;amp;2.0"&gt;
New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; declare the 37th Parallel North to be the state
boundary, that boundary was surveyed by different people at
different times, and none of them entirely accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, there was a suit by New Mexico against Colorado to
declare the more northern line the correct boundary, but the
Supreme Court &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;amp;vol=267&amp;amp;invol=30"&gt;
decided in 1925&lt;/a&gt; that the more southern, "Darling Line",
"...must be now taken as the established boundary between the two
States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I was right - the cache is south of what
we now recognize as the 37th Parallel, declared to be the state
boundary. I was also wrong - the place on the ground surveyed then
as the 37th Parallel, but now recognized by our GPS receivers to be
not quite the 37th Parallel, is the legally accepted border between
the two States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to those who pointed out the error of my ways, and
I've learned a big lesson! I'm updating this cache page to note
that it's in Colorado, not New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints></groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="17040293"><groundspeak:date>2006-07-06T07:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">We thought this cache was placed quite cleverly.

So you need to follow these clues. You should be on a trail for ALL of this adventure.

1) Drive to the top of Olinda road to the start of the trail which is well marked as Waihou Springs Trail.

2) Follow the trail and take the loop trail to the highest point uphill. Then find a less travelled trail which continues uphill and to the right. Sometimes people place sticks and branches over the start of this less traveled trail so people do not mistake it for the loop trail but the trail is still visible. 

2) Follow the less traveled trail up and then to the right to cross the gulch at the rocky waterfall top and streambed (Do NOT climb down into or fall into the ravine). 

3) Now walk back down the mountain (you will actually be walking uphill) along the edge of the gully in a cow pasture. At this pont your GPS should be working and you should be able to start your search for the Geo Cache.

The cache is a 8 quart rubbermade container and contains some very fine things :-)

</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The eastern half of this park was once an electrical substation.
A few years ago the power company determined that many of these
substations were no longer needed as they had developed new methods
of transmitting the power through new and existing lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly the remnants of whatever stuff they had behind the fence
was removed and it was decided that the space would make a nice
pocket park. Upon further review, they decided that if it was twice
as big it would be twice as nice. Many of the people and companies
you see listed on plaques in the park donated money to buy the
house which used to sit on the lot to the west of the substation.
It was then torn down and this lovely park began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the entry to the park divide the sum of twice the number of
benches with backs, twice the number of columns, and four times the
number of checker tables by one thousand and add one third of that
number to the posted latitude and two thirds of that number to the
posted longitude. Proceed to the second location where you should
add one fourth of two and one half times the number of cement roses
divided by one thousand to the posted longitude and three fourths
of two and one half times the number of cement roses divided by one
thousand to the posted latitude. Proceed to the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Hamilton holds the log sheet for the first to find. It
pays to be tiresome. For those that come later, enjoy what you see
and realize what people can do for their neighborhood when they
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to fishiam and Camp Latona for the
co-FTF&lt;/b&gt;. They did phone to make sure they were in the right
place and I assured them that they were. I'm sure the &lt;b&gt;strong&lt;/b&gt;

discovery. That was reason enough to select Seattle's Discovery
Park as the cache site for Washington's entry into the Cache Across
America series. Seattle is also a gateway to the Pacific, thus a
beach hide seemed also appropriate. Finally, this is my family's
favorite beach in the city so we are motivated to properly maintain
this cache. The cache is a large ammo can. It is available at all
water levels but is somewhat easier to access at lower than high
tide since the beach walk is simpler than the driftwood scramble.
Please re-hide at least as well as you found it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are quite a few other caches in Discovery Park you may enjoy
when you visit:&lt;br&gt;

railroad was constructed from Dawson to Tucumcari and the town was
born. Then in 1906, the Phelps Dodge company bought the mine and
increased development. Dawson went on to have its own newspaper,
the Dawson News, a theater, hotel, modern homes, hospital, baseball
park, golf course, bowling alley and more. Dawson's high school
basketball and football teams went on to win many awards. Then
disaster struck, not once, but twice. On October 22, 1913 at 3:10
P.M., an explosion in the mine killed 263 minors plus two rescuers.
Then on February 8, 1923 at 2 P.M., another explosion killed 120
men. Surprisingly though, the town didn't die, but rather went on
until the mine was closed down in 1950. When the mine closed,
Phelps Dodge sold the whole town, buildings and all, to be carried
off to other locations. Today, the cemetery is the main thing to
see at Dawson. 
&lt;p&gt;Getting there : Turn off Hwy. 64 on to Dawson Rd., just south of
the Colfax Tavern. Drive 5 miles on Dawson road and you made
it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Rudy Clark family of Marblemount decided that the chapel could be salvaged and asked the Monroe Christian Reform Church if they could take it. The chapel was relocated to Marblemount, rebuilt and dedicated on June 5, 1977.  

If you have time, take a peak inside the Clark Eatery across the road.  The Clark family ancestors were some of the original inhabitants of Marblemount and the family still lives there. In their small restaurant across from the Wildwood Chapel they have set up a small museum full of interesting artifacts dating back to the founding of Marblemount. Outside the restaurant, the grounds are always teaming with rabbits which are a big hit for kids and adults alike.

This cache is a traditional cache. It is a medium sized ammo box with the name of the cache clearly written on each side.

The theme of this cache is postcards. It contains eight stamped unused postcards, once you find the cache, feel free to take a postcard and send it to someone you miss. Maybe invite them to join you on your next geocaching adventure. Do not forget to leave a stamped postcard in its place (the more exotic the better).

The coordinates may be a bit off due to the pine trees.

After you find the cache, sit a while and enjoy the view. If you wait long enough you might get a chance to see the osprey that lives near by.


Please be sure to hide this cache well when you are done.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints></groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="24975003"><groundspeak:date>2007-03-30T07:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it with my mother in law.

Formerly a commercial port Ma'alaea Harbor now hosts a marina where
many cruise and pleasure boats dock.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;center&gt;Among the boats that dock here are whale watching cruise
boats as well as those that offer snorkeling trips to Molokini
Atol.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;The waters and reefs of Ma'alaea are important to many
species. Ma'alaea Bay is part of the National Humpback Whale Marine
Sanctuary - a favorite mating and birthing grounds for the
endangered Humpbacks. Green Sea Turtles browse reefs that border
the harbor entrance.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;When a robust south swell hits Maui, surfers from far and
near head for Ma'alaea to have a chance to experience the tubular
perfection of one of the world's fastest rideable waves - the
legendary Ma'alaea Pipeline wave..&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;The wave called Ma'alaea is a right hander off the jetty
and over a shallow coral reef. It is considered to be one of the
world's fastest waves.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;A proposed extension of the jetty to enlarge the harbor
will destroy the wave and much of the coral reef.&lt;/center&gt;

This cache is along an easily navigated trail that runs south to north. Don’t be too concerned about getting lost – all the trails eventually merge into one. 

The difficulty rating is primarily due to tree cover that could make getting a clear lock difficult. I would suggest locking on to distances whenever possible and using dead-reckoning when all else fails.

We have tried to make this easy due to this being a  very high muggle area.  No need to get on your knees, just reach under then up and over if you dare.

</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a micro cache that we had prepared and left in our glove
box for rapid deployment. There's no challenge getting to within a
very small distance of the cache. The hard part will be finding it.
This is your typical urban cache in a rural location. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; We checked this cache right after placement, and
found that the container was not very weather-resistant. We changed
the container to a small spice bottle, which is much more
waterproof and it can now hold small items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location is one of my favorite spots along the road system.
A great location to watch a sunset, or take a break along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache contains a log book. Bring writing implement to sign
log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First to find earns a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rated the difficulty as 2.5. Depending on the condition of
the immediate surroundings and camo materials we used to hide the
cache, could be as easy as a 1 (in plain sight) to a 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is one that might be used in certain urban
situations, and while there is a way to use this container in this
setting, the particular feature that makes the container useful is
not necessary for this hiding place. &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; The container has
been changed. See information above. I also re-confirmed the
coordinates, and they are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

Park in Kenmore Village, there are loads of parking spots available in the square and stroll back past the orphanage and over the bridge. Please do not park in the Kenmore Club parking area, as this is for visitors to their facilities only and not for walkers.

Turn left into the Kenmore Club, there is a right of way through the grounds which starts off at N56° 35.205  W004° 00.254. This is an obvious paved path along side of the wall, enclosing the cottages. Once you leave the clubs grounds the path becomes a rough track, which leads into the woods.  

While you wander through the woods, take a look at the height of some of the trees. We've always wondered how old some of these trees actually are and how did they get to be here. Where they planted as part of the castle estate or a spill over from the abbey on the island, or something else. 

While the trees are in full leaf the GPS signal may vary. Although we had a good signal in amongst the trees at the time of placing, when most of the trees were still covered in leaves.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>In the roots of a hollow tree</groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="44642617"><groundspeak:date>2008-04-28T19:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">It was a little swampy along the trail, but we still tracked it down... then drove into town, parked by the lake and ate bread and cheese.

The Cross bones graveyard in Red Cross Way, close to Borough Tube Station.
You will see a gate of rusty iron bars adorned with glittering ribbons, flowers, feathers and other curious items.  There is also a large skull and crossbones in place.

This is a unconsecrated grave yard where the prostitutes and paupers of the Borough were buried from medieval times until the 1850's. It is believed that 15,000 are buried here.
In medieval times the prostitutes of the area [known as the Winchester Geese]were licensed by the Bishop of Winchester but were denied burial in consecrated ground.  The graveyard was later used as a paupers burial ground.     The grave yard was rediscovered when bodies were found during the building of the Jubillee line and since that time people have been campaigning for a small memorial garden to the forgotten dead to be allowed on the site which is currently concreted over.

Ritual and drama events are carried out on the site frequently. The rituals are simple,inclusive and non dogmatic, emphasing respect for the 'ancestors' and honouring the spirit of the place.
The Halloween of cross bones has been observed every halloween night since 1998 with hundreds making a candlelit procession to the site.
Some meet monthly at 7.00pm on the 23rd of the month to maintain the gate area.

Across the road is 'The Boot and Flogger' wine bar which occupies an anonymous grey building opposite, looking very much like Dickens description of Dombey's counting house rather than a place of intoxication and frivolity!
This is a very high calibre wine bar.  On entering you find a long, generous sized room with lots of romantic cubby holes for those requiring solitude.  The furnishings are very comfortable and the atmosphere extremely convivial.
Excellent, well priced wines and food and the toilets are well worth a visit in themselves.
Closes at 8.00 pm however.</groundspeak:long_description><groundspeak:encoded_hints>behind lower ivy clad planter [now dead!] on left of gate</groundspeak:encoded_hints><groundspeak:logs><groundspeak:log id="44641107"><groundspeak:date>2008-05-05T19:00:00</groundspeak:date><groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type><groundspeak:finder id="443753">dave_n_ang</groundspeak:finder><groundspeak:text encoded="False">Cool spot, and interesting story.

A lovely walk from the West, over the footbridges. &lt;br /&gt;

There is a large pay and display car park at N53 16.745 W003 49.718, from which the orchard is a short level walk across a (sometimes muddy!) field to the edge of the medieaval town walls.  It is buggy accessible but perhaps not for wheelchairs in the winter, one of the project aims is to install a disabled access path</groundspeak:short_description><groundspeak:long_description html="False">Background

There is been evidence of orchards in the vicinity of the walls of Conwy since the times of its mediaeval origin.  The remnants of an orchard can still be found on the south side of the town walls, below the former Cadnant school site.  Many local people of all ages have tales of “scrumping” from there over the years, but even now the majority of the fruit found there, apples, pears and plum varieties, goes to waste.  The orchard is unmaintained and overgrown, and may deteriorate further if no action is taken.

The plan

It is hoped that this historical location can be the focus of a restoration and expansion project for the benefit of the local community.  Through setting up a group of interested volunteers the aim is to seek grants and funding to partially restore and enhance the existing site, expand the orchard through grafting and planting native or rare fruit trees into new areas, provide information boards on the site, and annually undertake an autumn harvest of the fruit to distribute to the local community. Future developments may also be to use the site as a centre for the wider harvest and distribution of other surplus apples and fruit people may have from their own gardens. The restored orchard would be another attraction for locals and visitors to the town, covering many fields of interest:

The cache is an odd shaped small, almost a mighty micro, at the orchard site itself.  beware being overlooked by muggles on the town wall walk above!  please try to ensure the cache is wedged back in as found.
